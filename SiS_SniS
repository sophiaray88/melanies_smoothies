The biggest differences between SiS and SniS are: 

1) How users connect to your app.  
2) How you connect your app to Snowflake. 

With SniS, users will be able to connect to your app more easily. You can set up your SniS app in a way that doesn't require 
them to log in or have a USER in your Snowflake account. In fact, Streamlit will host your app for free if you make it open to the public. 
Connecting your app to Snowflake is less easy in SniS than it was in SiS. In SiS, the connection happened automatically. In Streamlit, we'll need to carry out a number of steps.
